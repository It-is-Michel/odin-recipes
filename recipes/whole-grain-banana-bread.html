        <h2>About the meal</h2>
        <p>Don't let the healthy name fool you, this banana bread is moist and full of flavor. Whole grains, high fiber and low fat and sugar are just the added benefits. My family devours it! This can also be made in 4 mini loaf pans, just bake for 25 to 30 minutes at the same temperature.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup SPLENDA® Sugar Blend</li>
            <li>¾ cup flax seed meal</li>
            <li>5 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>¼ cup skim milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup low-fat sour cream</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons egg whites</li>
            <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and a 9x5 inch loaf pan.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the sugar blend, flax meal, bananas, milk, sour cream and egg whites until well blended. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the banana mixture until moistened. Spoon into prepared loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the crown of the loaf comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
