        <h2>About the meal</h2>
        <p>This healthy chicken salad recipe is made with a mixture of Greek yogurt and cottage cheese instead of regular mayonnaise, resulting in a healthier version that's still creamy and delicious but higher in protein. Apples and dried cranberries add a sweet-tart flavor, while chopped pecans provide textural interest in every bite. Serve it on crackers, on a croissant, in a pita, or grab a fork and just dig in!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Yogurt: This chicken salad starts with a container of fat-free Greek yogurt.</li>
            <li>Cottage cheese: Low-fat cottage cheese adds richness and creaminess. Some reviewers like to substitute ricotta.</li>
            <li>Vegetables: You'll need chopped celery and onion.</li>
            <li>Fruit: Chopped apples and dried cranberries deliver bursts of sweet, fruity flavor.</li>
            <li>Pecans: Chopped pecans add welcome crunch and nutty flavor.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: This healthy chicken salad is flavored with Dijon mustard, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Chicken: Of course, you'll need chicken. This is a great way to use leftover cooked chicken.</li>
