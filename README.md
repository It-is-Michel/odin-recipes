# odin-recipes
My first project with HTML

This page is about recipes. You will find three recipes, each one with name, a picture of the meal, the needed ingredients and a list of steps.

I will practice:
 - headings (h1, h2, ...)
 - ordered and unordered lists (ol, ul, li)
 - paragraphs (p)
 - images (img)
 - href and src attributes and paths (to add links and images)
 - setting up the "boilerplate" of html
 - Git commands
 - commiting with Git
 - Linux commands
 - my English hehe
